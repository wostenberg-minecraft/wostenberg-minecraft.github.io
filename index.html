        <p>
            Welcome to minecraft.wostenberg.com! This is a community-oriented Minecraft server with an emphasis on player freedom (you could call it a libretarian server :) ). This is neither a top-down heavily structured pay-to-win server, nor a total anarchy server.
        </p>
        <div>
            <a name="ServerRules"><h2>Server rules</h2></a>
            <p>
                <b>TL;DR: Don't grief or steal from clearly marked property without explicit permission, don't engage in PvP without explicit permission, and don't cause server instability.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                All players on the server are granted certain freedoms (the act of whitelisting a player grants them these freedoms). Players may conduct themselves in whatever way they see fit as long as they do not infringe upon other players' freedoms. Players are however subject to cruel and unusual punishement* at owner discression—the owner has given you these priveleges, and can take them away.
            </p>
            <p>
                * <i>I'm somewhat joking—punishments including the standard things like revoking freedoms, kicking, banning, etc.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Player freedoms:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Freedom to consent</b> to alienation of your own rights. You can give another player (explicit) permission to infringe any of your rights. For example, Bob can give Alice permission to kill him in what would normally be an infringement of Bob's freedom to life (#5). Basically you can consent to allow someone to do whatever they want to you on the server. Silence does not equal consent—unless a player explicitly gives a "yes" to dueling, for example, they are not considered to consent.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to play</b> on the server itself. While I do my best to keep the server running smoothly, I can't garentee anything. Infringements of this freedom include things like DDOSing and causing server instability.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to keep property</b>, within reason. This cannot be expected to be upheld if you do not clearly mark your territory. Unreasonable property could include things such as claiming inordinate amounts of territory over a short amount of time. Griefing someone else's property could constitute a infringement of this freedom.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to keep items and things.</b> Again, this can only be expected to be upheld if it is obvious that these items are clearly owned by the player. Stealing from another player could constitute an infrigmement of this freedom, and so could taking a player's dropped items after a consenting duel.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to life.</b> Killing another player would constitute an infringement of this freedom.</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to fair vanilla playing field.</b> A player playing on an unmodified vanilla client should not have a disadvanted when compared to any other player on the server. Using a hacked client to perform actions that give you an advantage over vanilla clients (for example x-raying, kill auras, speedhacking, etc) would constitute an infringement of this freedom. An x-ray texture pack in the vanilla game is still an infringement. On the other hand, client-side shader mods or schematics mods would be perfectly fine. If in doubt, a good question to ask yourself might be: "Could I still do X if I downloaded the latest unmodified client from Mojang and tried to do X?"</li>
                <li><b>Freedom to communicate</b> via server mechanisms. For example, chat spamming would constitute an infringement of this freedom.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                However, the owner still owns the server and retains full rights to change or do anything at all to the server and its data. The owner also reserves full rights to change these rules at will—this is not a democracy!
